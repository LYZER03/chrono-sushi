# Implementation Progress - Sushi Samurai Express

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

### Completed Tasks

#### 1.1 Environment & Repository Setup (2023-05-14)

- [x] Initialize Git repository
  - Created Git repository with initial commit
  - Set up proper file tracking and version control

- [x] Create `.gitignore` file for React/TypeScript/Node
  - Added comprehensive ignore patterns for node_modules, build artifacts, environment files, and editor configurations
  - Included specific patterns for Supabase and deployment platforms

- [x] Set up project directory structure
  - Used Vite to scaffold the initial React+TypeScript project
  - The project follows a clean, organized structure with separate directories for components, pages, styles, etc.

- [x] Create `README.md` with project overview
  - Added comprehensive project overview
  - Included details on features, tech stack, and setup instructions
  - Documented development environment configurations

#### 1.2 Development Environment Configuration (2023-05-14)

- [x] Install Node.js and npm
  - Confirmed Node.js v16+ is available

- [x] Set up Vite with React and TypeScript
  - Successfully created a Vite project with React and TypeScript template
  - Verified the development server runs correctly

- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - Enhanced ESLint configuration with additional plugins for React hooks, JSX accessibility, and Prettier integration
  - Created Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
  - Set up rules to enforce code quality and style conventions

- [x] Environment variables
  - Created `.env.example` template file for environment variable management
  - Added configuration for development, testing, and production environments

#### 1.3 Supabase Setup (2023-05-14)

- [x] Create Supabase integration
  - Installed Supabase client library (@supabase/supabase-js)
  - Created type definitions for database tables
  - Implemented database schema with SQL migrations
  - Created seed data for testing purposes

- [x] Set up API clients
  - Created base Supabase client with connection validation
  - Implemented authentication service with login/signup/reset functionality
  - Built generic collections API for CRUD operations
  - Added media management service for file uploads

- [x] Configure authentication
  - Set up JWT-based authentication flow
  - Implemented role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Customer)
  - Added social authentication support (Google)

- [x] Environment configuration
  - Created environment variable templates (.env.example)
  - Implemented environment-specific configuration utilities
  - Added support for dev/test/prod environments
  - Documented Supabase setup process

### In Progress

#### 1.4 State Management & API Layer
- [ ] Set up Zustand store structure
- [ ] Implement React Query for API data fetching
- [ ] Create base API client for Supabase interaction
- [ ] Set up environment variables for different environments (dev/test/prod)

### Validation Results

- ✅ Repository successfully initialized with initial commit
- ✅ Directory structure matches the planned architecture
- ✅ README contains accurate project description
- ✅ Development server runs correctly (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier correctly configured

### Next Steps

1. Complete Supabase setup
2. Begin implementing state management and API layer

### Notes

- Used Vite instead of Create React App due to its superior performance and modern defaults
- Enhanced ESLint configuration beyond basic requirements to ensure code quality
