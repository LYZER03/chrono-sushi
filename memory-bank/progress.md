- [ ] Create theme configuration
- [ ] Build core layout components (layout, header, footer)

### Validation Results

- ✅ Repository successfully initialized with initial commit
- ✅ Directory structure matches the planned architecture
- ✅ README contains accurate project description
- ✅ Development server runs correctly (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier correctly configured
- ✅ Supabase integration successfully tested (2023-05-14)
  - API client connection test passes
  - Authentication service functions validated
  - Collections API CRUD operations tested
  - All 21 tests passing cleanly

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Supabase setup (2023-05-14)
2. Begin implementing state management and API layer (starting with Zustand and React Query)

### Notes

- Used Vite instead of Create React App due to its superior performance and modern defaults
- Enhanced ESLint configuration beyond basic requirements to ensure code quality
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for Supabase integration with Vitest
- Followed best practices for mocking in TypeScript tests, using module-level mocks
