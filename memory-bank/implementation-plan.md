## Notes on Development Approach

In accordance with the provided rules:

1. We will always start up a new server after making changes for testing
2. We will prioritize iterating on existing code instead of creating new code
3. We will maintain existing patterns unless there's a compelling reason to change
4. We will kill all existing related servers before starting a new one
5. We will prefer simple solutions over complex ones
6. We will avoid code duplication by reviewing the codebase before implementing new features
7. We will write clean, organized code that takes into account different environments
8. We will only make changes that are requested or well understood
9. We will refactor files that exceed 200-300 lines of code
10. We will write thorough tests for all major functionality
11. We will avoid touching code unrelated to the current task
